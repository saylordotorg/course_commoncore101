**Unit 3: Developing Content That Is Aligned With The Common Core State
Standards** <span id="3"></span> 
*The main purpose of the Common Core State Standards is to provide a
framework for what students should be learning at each grade level in
order to prepare them for college and careers.  The standards do not
prescribe specific texts that must be used, specific activities for
students, or mandated unit structures for courses.  However, the
ELA/Literacy standards do provide lists of example texts that
demonstrate the appropriate level of complexity that should be mastered
at each grade level.  In Mathematics, a coherent progression in
complexity is established, with guidelines for various methods of
grouping the standards depending on whether a traditional or accelerated
approach is desired.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 3.5 hours to complete.  Subunit
time estimates will differ depending on your area of specialty.  For
example, high school English educators focusing on ELA/Literacy should
spend more time reviewing the content for ELA/Literacy and related
informational texts and less time reviewing the content for
mathematics.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Provide examples of texts that are appropriate for each assigned
    course.
-   Evaluate texts for a level complexity that is appropriate for an
    assigned grade level and/or course.
-   Evaluate whether a resource meets Common Core State Standards
    objectives.
-   Develop an approach for developing units and lessons that are
    aligned with the Common Core State Standards.

**3.1 Content for English Language Arts & Literacy in History/Social
Studies, Science and Technical Subjects** <span id="3.1"></span> 
The Common Core State Standards provide example texts that serve as
reference points for the level and variety of texts that should be read
in each grade level.  The greatest emphasis in the ELA/Literacy
standards is the careful examination of a text and the development of
critical thinking skills in approaching a text.  Students are encouraged
to read a mix of fiction and non-fiction texts, and the responsibility
for comprehensive literacy education is shared among English language
arts teachers as well as other subject-area teachers.

**3.2 Text Complexity in ELA/Literacy** <span id="3.2"></span> 
One of the goals of the Common Core State Standards initiative for
ELA/Literacy is to increase the complexity of texts that students are
reading and to ensure that the texts students read at each grade level
are appropriately challenging.  Some useful tools have been developed to
calibrate and evaluate text complexity; these tools are described in
comprehensive detail in the readings below.

**3.3 Content for Informational Texts** <span id="3.3"></span> 
One of the main ways in which Common Core State Standards may differ
from existing standards is in their emphasis on ensuring that students
are reading non-fiction, informational texts as well as works of
fiction.  The Common Core State Standards make clear that the
responsibility for developing literacy is shared among all subject
teachers and that students should be developing their ability to read
and analyze non-fiction works of increasing complexity.  In order to do
this, the Common Core initiative has developed examples of informational
texts of appropriate complexity for each grade level, as well as helpful
methods for evaluating text complexity.

**3.4 Text Complexity in Informational Texts** <span id="3.4"></span> 
Along with the Common Core State Standards initiative’s focus on
increasing the complexity of literary texts that students read, the
initiative also emphasizes the reading of appropriately challenging
informational texts in all subjects and at each grade level.  Educators
in non-fiction subject areas may be less accustomed to evaluating text
complexity, so additional guidance has been provided by Common Core
State Standards initiative for assessing the complexity level of
informational texts.

**3.5 Content for Mathematics** <span id="3.5"></span> 
The goals of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics are to
improve achievement in mathematics, to present math concepts in a more
unified and coherent way, and to develop increased mathematical
understanding.  The “Standards for Mathematical Practice,” outlined in
subunit 2.3 of this course, are unifying principles for approaching
mathematical problems that apply to all grade levels.  In addition, the
high school mathematics standards are grouped into six concept areas –
Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Modeling, Geometry, and
Statistics and Probability – which can be combined in various ways
according to different content goals.  The Common Core State Standards
strive to make the progression of math by grade level more logical and
to cover fewer subjects in greater depth.  
  
 *Note: In Common Core-aligned mathematics curriculum, the term*
Problem *is used to describe materials in which students are required to
learn new concepts.  The term* Exercise *is used to describe materials
in which students are required to practice concepts they have already
learned in order build mastery in those concepts.*

**3.6 How Do the Common Core State Standards Mathematics Concepts Line
Up with Conventional Math Course Sequences?** <span id="3.6"></span> 
The Common Core State Standards for high school mathematics are
organized by concept group – Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions,
Modeling, Geometry, and Statistics and Probability – as opposed to a
traditional course progression sequence such as Algebra I, Algebra II,
etc.  However, the appendix to the Common Core State Standards offers
suggestions for how to integrate these concept groups into traditional,
accelerated, and integrated course-progression models.

**3.7 Evaluating the Quality of Resources** <span id="3.7"></span> 
It can be difficult to determine the quality of available resources and
texts for K-12 courses – even those that are purportedly in alignment
with Common Core State Standards.  This is due to the increased need for
Common Core-compliant resources and the motivation on the part of
publishers to reuse existing materials.  As a result, some of the
educators involved with developing the Common Core State Standards have
established guidelines for determining whether resources are genuinely
aligned with the new standards.  At Saylor, we will use the guidelines
in the below resources to ensure that our courses meet all the
educational goals set forth in the Common Core State Standards.

     Instructions: Please click the link above and scroll to the bottom

    with the themes of the Common Core State Standards.  If you are
    developing a course in ELA/Literacy or a K-5 level course, please
    pay particular attention to the criteria for selecting texts found
    on pages 3-13 of the document.  If you are developing a course in
    Social Studies, Science, Mathematics or another Technical Subject,
    pay particular attention to the criteria for selecting texts found
    on pages 14-19.

    mathematics course, please read the section titled “Criteria for
    Materials and Tools Aligned to the Standards” on pages 5-19. 
    Mathematics educators also should read the appendix starting on page
    20 and note the sample rubric starting on page 22.  While this
    document specifically addresses the K-8 mathematics curriculum, the
    introduction and explanations of what should appear in a Common Core
    State Standards curriculum are also valuable in structuring 9-12
    grade-level instruction.  According to the Common Core State
    Standards initiative, more information that is specific to high
    school instruction is forthcoming.
