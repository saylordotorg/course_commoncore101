*In the first unit of this course, you will learn what the Common Core
State Standards are, how they were developed, why Saylor uses these
standards, and the main focal points of the multi-state initiative to
implement the Common Core State Standards.*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Define the Common Core State Standards.
-   Explain key points in the historical development of the Common Core
    State Standards.
-   List some of the reasons to design courses around the Common Core
    State Standards.
-   Summarize the big picture focuses of the Common Core State
    Standards.

**1.1 What Are the Common Core State Standards?** <span
id="1.1"></span> 
The Common Core State Standards are a set of K-12 educational standards
that are the result of a recent collective movement by state leaders to
improve college and career readiness among high school graduates. The
National Governors Association Center for Best Practices (the NGA
Center) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) led the
movement to create a new set of standards for determining high-school
graduates’ preparedness for college and career tracks.  A draft of the
college and career standards was released in July 2009.  From these
standards, more detailed expectations for each K-12 grade level
subsequently were developed, incorporating the best existing state
standards, the input of educators and education leaders, and feedback
from the public.  The resulting Common Core State Standards have
currently been finalized for grades K-12 in the subject areas of
ELA/Literacy and Mathematics. Currently, 45 states have endorsed the
Common Core State Standards and have at least some implementation
efforts in place.  Forty-four of these states have expressed a
commitment to implementing assessments based on the new standards for
the 2014-2015 school year in addition to replacing their previous
individual standards.  The movement toward adopting the Common Core
State Standards represents a rare, cross-state consensus in United
States education.   

**1.2 Why Common Core?** <span id="1.2"></span> 
The Saylor Foundation has chosen to build its K-12 curriculum around the
Common Core State Standards because these standards represent the most
significant collaboration among educational leaders towards nation-wide
consistency in educational standards.  In addition, these standards have
gained widespread support and implementation.  They incorporate many of
the current best teaching practices in K-12 education, aimed toward
preparing students for college and/or their future careers and
encouraging common understanding among parents, teachers, and students
about what is expected at each grade level.  The standards encourage
critical thinking, problem solving, and increased literacy.  We believe
that open access to comprehensive courses built around these standards
provides a valuable resource to K-12 students and educators in both
public and alternative education sectors worldwide – in part because
these standards were informed by educational standards in other
top-performing countries, such as Singapore, Finland, Japan, and
Canada.  As such, we believe that a curriculum based on the Common Core
State Standards is relevant for students located anywhere in the world.
 

**1.3 How Were the Common Core State Standards Developed?** <span
id="1.3"></span> 
The Common Core State Standards were developed using the collaborative
input of educators and educational experts and leaders across many
states.  They were built using elements of the best existing state
standards as well as evidence-based educational studies.  After the
initial drafts of the standards were developed, they were released for
public comment in March 2010.  Feedback from the public was considered
and subsequently incorporated into the final standards, which were
released in June 2010.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the webpage
    in its entirety.  Since the Common Core State Standards were
    released, there have been a lot of questions raised about the
    content, quality, and implementation of the standards.  This webpage
    answers many of those questions, provides some context for
    understanding the development and content of the standards, and
    addresses common misconceptions about the standards.

**1.4 What Are the Main Themes of the Common Core State Standards?**
<span id="1.4"></span> 
The main goals of the Common Core State Standards are to establish the
knowledge and skills necessary for college and career readiness among
high school graduates and to work toward developing these skillsets at
each grade level.  Overall, the Common Core State Standards stress
literacy and critical thinking, requiring students to think deeply about
subjects and ideas.  Specifically, the ELA/Literacy standards focus on
increasing literacy and critically examining both fiction and
non-fiction texts at all levels of K-12 study.  The ELA/Literacy
standards also include grade-level guidelines for reading, writing,
speaking, listening, and other aspects of language communication.  In
the area of Mathematics, the Common Core State Standards emphasize
cultivating an understanding of key mathematical principles and
overarching ideas, such as developing abstract and quantitative
reasoning.  The Mathematics standards also cover key conceptual
categories – such as functions, statistics, and probability – and
encourage students to apply mathematical thinking to real-world
challenges.

    descriptions of the three shifts for ELA/Literacy and Mathematics.
     This document describe the three main ways in which the Common Core
    State Standards differ from most previous standards in each
    discipline.  These are the major ideas that should guide your
    development of courses that are aligned with the Common Core State
    Standards.
