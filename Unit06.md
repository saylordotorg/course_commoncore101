course_description: "Common Core 101 aims to provide educators with an overview of the Common Core State Standards; top resources for developing content; and the main benchmarks for ensuring that a K-12 course is compliant with new state standards. After a push by the National Governor’s Association in 2009, common core standards have been adopted by 45 states (and 3 territories) with some state assessments slated to begin in 2014-2015. This is a non-credit professional development module."
