title: "Common Core 101"
course_description: "Common Core 101 aims to provide educators with an overview of the Common Core State Standards; top resources for developing content; and the main benchmarks for ensuring that a K-12 course is compliant with new state standards. After a push by the National Governor’s Association in 2009, common core standards have been adopted by 45 states (and 3 territories) with some state assessments slated to begin in 2014-2015. This is a non-credit professional development module."

**Unit 4: Assessing And Measuring Student Progress Towards Achieving The
Goals Of The Common Core State Standards** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit we will look at the development of assessments that are
intended to test student mastery of the Common Core State Standards as
well as methods for measuring student progress towards mastery of the
standards.  In addition, we will look at resources for developing
educational activities, assessment questions, and sample performance
tasks aligned with the Common Core State Standards.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 1.5 hours to complete.  Subunit
time estimates may differ depending on your area of specialty.  For
example, mathematics educators should review sample performance tasks
for mathematics in greater detail and sample performance tasks for
ELA/Literacy in less detail.

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   List some sample performance tasks for an assigned course.
-   Develop activities and assessments to measure student progress.

**4.1 Sample Performance Tasks** <span id="4.1"></span> 
The recommended shifts in instructional focus that are prevalent within
the Common Core State Standards also necessitate a shift in the types of
questions, activities, and assessments in which students participate. 
One of the major differences is the need for teachers to ask more
questions that are text- and evidence-based.  Examples of performance
tasks for each area are embedded in the appendices to the Common Core
State Standards for ELA/Literacy, available in the readings below.

**4.2 Assessment** <span id="4.2"></span> 
The Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers
(PARCC) is a 23-state consortium working together to develop
next-generation, Common Core-compliant K-12 assessments in ELA/Literacy
and Mathematics.  The assessments are scheduled to be ready for the
2014-2015 school year.  In the interim, please use PARCC’s draft
materials to guide the development of your own assessments.
