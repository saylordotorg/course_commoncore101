This course is designed to prepare Saylor’s consulting educators to
build K-12 subject courses that are aligned with the Common Core State
Standards in English Language Arts & Literacy in History/Social Studies,
Science and Technical Subjects and Mathematics.  You will begin this
course by gaining an overview of what the set of Common Core State
Standards is, why Saylor is focused on developing courses around the
Common Core State Standards, and the main benchmarks for ensuring that a
course is compliant with the Common Core State Standards.  In unit 2 of
this course, you will look at the Common Core State Standards in detail
and identify key takeaways from them.  In unit 3 of this course, you
will explore how to develop content that meets the Common Core State
Standards and how to integrate the standards through the development of
learning assignments based on specific texts and activities.  In unit 4
of this course, you will take a look at the different assessment
strategies often used for Common Core courses and determine how to
measure learning outcomes and student progress in these courses.  In the
final unit of this course, you will explore some additional resources
for understanding and implementing the Common Core State Standards in
your own courses.
